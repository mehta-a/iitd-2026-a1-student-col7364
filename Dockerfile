# as a Cython or pybind11 extension (see docs/SUBMISSION_INTERFACE.md,
# "Compiled extensions") builds correctly here and in course staff's
# grading image (instructor-tools/Dockerfile.grading, kept in lockstep
# with this one). Installed at image-build time only; the grading
# container still runs with --network none at scoring time.
